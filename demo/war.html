                        Those <strong>tournaments</strong> which have been going on in this world for
                        <strong>centuries</strong> are what
                        <strong>humans call war</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        For <strong>Centuries</strong> , humans have been fighting each other for resources , land ,
                        religion ,
                        discrimination or to show themselves superior or special ! <br> <br>

                        Ever since <strong>human evolution</strong> began , humans have been fighting each other ! <br>
                        <br>

                        Earlier humans fought to grab each other's food ! <br> <br>

                        Then humans started fighting in <strong>groups</strong> for more resources ! <br> <br>

                        Then humans fought in <strong>big tribes </strong>! <br> <br>

                        Then humans started <strong>farming</strong> , and fought for farming land or resources etc !
                        <br> <br>

                        Then humans formed states and fought wars for land and resources etc ! <br> <br>

                        Then humans formed <strong>countries</strong> ( more organized ) and divided themselves into
                        teams ( countries )
                        , and for more resources , they started <strong>wars</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        Now humans have come to a point where human civilization is about to end , there are so many
                        <strong>nuclear bombs</strong> in the world which can destroy the earth many times ,
                        <strong>climate change</strong> , <strong>global

                        Do you think humans are fighting because of resources, no, actually humans have got into the
                        habit of entertainment of fighting ! <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        Entertainment for humans means keeping one's mind busy! <br> <br>

                        Be it social media , movies , music , drama , sports or war ! <br> <br>

                        Among all these , the human mind is most busy in war ! <br> <br>

                        <strong>The reason is "unconsciousness" </strong>! <br> <br>

                        <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: red;">! Entertainment or War !</strong> <br> <br>


                        We can understand this through some examples of why we ourselves do not know why we are fighting
                        a war , no matter what the reason for fighting are ! <br> <br>

                        <strong> First example</strong> – “ <strong style="color: red;">Bigg Boss Show ”</strong> – <br>
                        <br>

                        In Big Boss , every contestant feels that he is right , and whatever he is doing , that is right
                        ! <br> <br>

                        But we the viewers know who is right and who is wrong, because we have a different perspective
                        for every contestant , every contestant considers himself right from his own perspective !

                    <h2></h2>
                    <p>
                        The contestants who activate their self doubt mode , that is start doing <strong>self
                            observation</strong> , they
                        win the <strong>show</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        <strong>Understand</strong> that this whole world is a Big Boss show , everyone feels that they
                        are right ,
                        everyone is with religion and truth ! <br> <br>

                        Whatever he is doing is right, both the shows are fake , the only difference is that, in one
                        <strong>one
                            knows</strong> that the show is fake while in the other one doesn't <strong>( Social
                            Perspective - Matrix
                            - “ I “
                            )</strong> , in one people die - in the other one they don't ! <br> <br>

                        There are <strong>fights</strong> in both ! <br> <br>

                        The <strong>audience</strong> is in both the shows ! <br> <br>

                        Everything is the same in both the shows, because humans are in both the shows ! <br> <br>

                        In both the shows , the audience is attracted to the fights ! <br> <br>

                        <strong>Reason - unconsciousness ! </strong>

                        Second Example - <strong>“ Arena of Romans”</strong> - <br> <br>

                        When Romans used to have big arenas , people used to fight in those arenas until they died, and
                        people (spectators) used to sit and watch ! <br> <br>

                        Understand that this whole world is an arena , some people are fighting and others are sitting
                        and watching. Nowadays everyone has a mobile, everyone has their own team (country), everyone is
                        supporting their own team . <br> <br>

                        In today's time, most people in the world has entered the war, whether they are on the front or
                        on
                        mobile or on the news !

                        You must have seen that when 2-4 people are fighting, 10-20 people stand and watch - have you
                        ever wondered why those 10-20 people are watching ! <br> <br>

                        Because they are enjoying that fight - whether it is a war or a small street fight, people are
                        just enjoying it ! <br> <br>

                        There are many countries which are fighting in the name of religion, they find the dead bodies
                        of their own people, then the whole world mourns for some time - actually the whole world needs
                        entertainment and those countries are fulfilling it by killing their <strong>own people</strong>
                        ! <br> <br>

                        This is how these war tournaments have been formed, everyone is just sitting and watching ! <br>
                        <br>

                        If there are war tournaments then there should be an industry for it too !

                        So let's see what is the budget of this industry. <br> <br>

                        In 2023, the world spent <strong>$ 2.44 trillion</strong> on its military, which was a 6.8%
                        increase from 2022.
                        This was the largest increase since 2009 ! <br> <br>

                        So what is the <strong>algorithm</strong> of this industry ? <br> <br>

                        One <strong>kills</strong> <br> <br>

                        The second <strong>dies</strong> <br> <br>

                        The third <strong>enjoys</strong> it <br> <br>

                        The fourth makes <strong>money</strong> <br> <br>

                        <strong style="font-size: 20px; color: red;"> ! How the third one Enjoys !</strong> <br> <br>

                        Suppose there is a <strong>team A</strong> ( country ) and a <strong>team B</strong> ( country )
                        , Team A thinks that team B is
                        wrong and team B thinks that team A is wrong ! <br> <br>

                        Because both the teams see only negative things in their ego ! <br> <br>

                        They think that they are saving their country, but from whom are they saving ? The people in
                        front of them are also humans , they have just forgotten due to their <strong>“ I ”</strong>
                        that they are also
                        humans ! <br> <br>

                        Then <strong>team C</strong> thinks that team A is right , then it forms an alliance with team A
                        and in the eyes
                        of team B , team C also comes in the category of enemy ! <br> <br>

                        Then in the same way <strong>team D</strong> joins team B . And then one by one the whole world
                        gets divided into
                        two parts , and the destruction <strong>begins</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        When the <strong>public</strong> (of any country) comes to know that a war has started
                        somewhere, then their mind
                        becomes a little busy ! <br> <br>

                        Then they come to know that today 100 (example) soldiers of Team A (country) are killed ! <br>
                        <br>

                        Then Team A and their supporters feel a little sad, and Team B and their supporters consider
                        themselves superior ! <br> <br>

                        Team A soldiers get medals after dying , some gun salutes, and some tears ! <br> <br>

                        Team B soldiers also get medals for killing other soldiers ! <br> <br>

                        Team A gets the respect in society, which a human being hungers for !

                        If some survive, they populate again and the tournament <strong>begins</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        These tournaments are played in the name of religion, resources, ideology, these are all
                        excuses, actually a person has to keep his mind busy ! <br>

                        Be it any emotion, sorrow or happiness ! <br> <br>

                        In today's time these tournaments have become a business!<br> <br>

                        The <strong>UN</strong> is just an <strong>umpire</strong> of this <strong>tournament

                        Some people think that they are protecting their religion . If this is so then their religion is

                        Dharma is eternal, infinite, beginningless, everything exists because of it ! <br>

                        Dharma is the reason why a planet rotates on its axis ! <br>

                    <p>
                        Now this industry has become a threat to humans , this industry will destroy human civilization
                        , and people will sit back and enjoy their end ! <br> <br>

                        I don't know if today's leadership will do this or not , but the coming generation which we call
                        <strong>Generation Z</strong> will destroy this planet , because they will neither have the
                        patience nor the
                        ability to make the right <strong>decisions</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        They have thousands of other <strong>excuses</strong> to fight ! <br> <br>

                        We are handing over the legacy of war and weapons to our future generations, we do not know when
                        someone will start a nuclear war and human civilization will end ! <br> <br>

                        Even if they (the new generation) survive now, they will destroy themselves later ! <br> <br>

                        There will be no <strong>humans</strong> , no <strong>tournaments</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        The name Generation Z sounds like - a strange name for a <strong>product</strong> of a
                        <strong>company</strong> !

                        As <strong>Oppenheimer</strong> once said when he invented the <strong>atomic bomb</strong> !

                        This was his futurism, he didn't say this just like that, he knew that this human species will
                        destroy this planet one day ! <br> <br>

                        And now this is the time when his futurism is going to come true ! <br> <br>

                        It will start when a <strong>nuclear war</strong> starts, then there will be no one left to
                        blame each other, no
                        leaders, no children, no trees and plants, no human civilization ! <br>

                        humans have always blamed each other for our mistakes like if there is a war then the
                        leadership is responsible, they are also humans, they have not come from another planet - one of
                        us becomes the Prime Minister, President or any leader who runs the countries ! <br> <br>

                        All these wars that are going on right now , not only the leaders are involved in them, the
                        people of those countries are also involved, they are just sitting and enjoying it, and
                        supporting their teams - and waiting for their end !

                        And the people who have built bunkers, they think that they will hide in the bunkers they have
                        built ! <br> <br>

                        How long will they hide, because there will be nothing left outside, there will be no oxygen,
                        there will be no life ! <br> <br>

                        What will be left - <br> <br>

                        There will be radiation pollution, there will be a shower of radiation, where will you go. <br>
                        <br>

                        First of all, you will be wiped out during the nuclear war, even if someone survives, he will
                        die of hunger or lack of oxygen ! <br> <br>

                        These wars are going on only because of us, no leader is responsible for this, we are all humans
                        because we are all sitting at home enjoying ourselves and blaming the leaders, leaders are also
                        humans ! <br>

                        When the public itself is enjoying itself, then what can one do ! <br> <br>

                        Some people or some countries do not want war, they want to live in peace, but a compulsion
                        arises , like <strong>Mahabharata</strong> ! <br>

                        Suppose there is a war between two countries, then the people of both the countries should
                        understand that if there is a war then there will be losses on <strong>both sides</strong> !

                        <strong> Before this, know how many types of humans are found in this world </strong> <br> <br>

                        There are four types of humans in this world - <br> <br>

                        1. <strong>Unconscious</strong> - Those who are totally unconscious, their viewpoint seems to be
                        the truth. Such
                        people (<strong>Politicians</strong>) give birth to wars, and such people
                        (<strong>public</strong>) enjoy wars ! <br> <br>

                        2. <strong>Conscious</strong> - These people are able to balance themselves ! <br> <br>

                        3. Neither <strong>unconscious</strong> or <strong>conscious</strong> - these people occur only
                        occasionally, these people are capable of balancing others also, because these people have
                        become void, have become connected with void !
                        <br> <br>

                        4. After ages and ages the <strong>Void ( Brahma )</strong> descends on this earth to fulfil
                        some promise made by him -
                        <br> <br>

                        When he descends he follows his own Dharma, Dharma is - <strong>Sanatan</strong> !

                        with bananas on the top rung. Whenever a monkey tried to climb the ladder, the experimenter
                        sprayed icy water on all the monkeys. Eventually, whenever a monkey tried to climb the ladder,
                        the other monkeys pulled him down and beat him so that they could avoid the icy water. Soon, no
                        monkey could muster the courage to climb the ladder !
                        <br> <br>

                        The experimenter replaced one of the monkeys in the cage with a new monkey. The new monkey first
                        tried to climb the ladder to reach the bananas. After being beaten several times, the new monkey
                        learned the social norms. He never knew <strong>“why”</strong> the other monkeys would not let
                        him have the
                        bananas because he had never been sprayed with ice water, but he quickly learned that this
                        behavior would not be tolerated by the other monkeys !

                    <p>
                        One by one, each monkey in the cage was replaced by a new monkey until there were none left from
                        the original group. Each time a new monkey climbed the ladder, the rest of the group pulled it
                        down, even those who had never been sprayed with ice water. <br> <br>

                        By the end of the experiment, the 5 monkeys in the cage had learned to follow the rule (don't go
                        for the bananas), none of them knowing the reason (they will all be sprayed with ice water).
                        <br>
                        <br> <br>

                        If we could ask the monkeys what their reason was for preventing their cage mates from climbing
                        the ladder, their answer would probably be: "<strong>I don't know, it's always been like
                            this</strong>" <br>
                        <br>

                        <b>My observation on this experiment</b> :- <br>

                        Whenever the monkeys climbed the ladder to get bananas, cold water was poured on them. Gradually
                        the monkeys stopped climbing the ladder as they were afraid that the water might be sprayed on
                        them. Then when some new monkeys were put in the cage, the old monkeys started preventing the
                        new monkeys from climbing the ladder !

                    <p>
                        Then gradually new monkeys kept coming and the old monkeys were taken out but no new monkeys
                        climbed the ladder because by then they were stuck in a pattern ( <strong>matrix</strong> )
                        which even they were
                        not aware of. All they knew was that they should not climb the ladder. They did not know whether
                        water would be sprayed on them or not. Then the generations kept changing but no one tried to
                        climb the ladder. They also did not know why ! <br> <br>

                        Now imagine that this whole world is a cage and we all are monkeys living in it ! <br>

                        When humans were evolving they fought out of compulsion because snatching prey was easier than
                        hunting. At that time there used to be open fields, all animals were faster than humans, only
                        man had his brain with the help of which he used to hunt, but snatching prey was easier than
                        hunting because man was physically less capable than animals ! <br> <br>

                        Then from then this pattern started that snatching prey is better than hunting and this pattern
                        continued from generation to generation now man started enjoying this pattern because there was
                        a feeling of freedom in this pattern because in that boring daily life sometimes hunting or
                        snatching prey gave him pleasure, a different feeling !

                        What is justified is hunting or snatching prey because they had no other option at that time
                        (<strong>at
                            that time human consciousness was not capable of making useful decisions</strong>). Then
                        humans
                        started farming but we did not stop hunting or snatching prey because then we started enjoying
                        it ! <br> <br>

                        Then this sequence continued from generation to generation because by then hunting or attacking
                        had become a form of entertainment for some humans, if it was not entertainment then they would
                        have done farming and made a living. The same sequence happened with monkeys too, the only
                        difference was that monkeys had forgotten to bring bananas and humans had forgotten why they had
                        started fighting because initially fighting was a compulsion, by then fighting had become their
                        entertainment !

                        As new generations came, they also adopted the same sequence like those monkeys ! <br> <br>

                        And mostly humans are still stuck in the same pattern, now we have started enjoying it ! <br>
