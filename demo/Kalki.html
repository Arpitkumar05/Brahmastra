                    <h2>Kalki Avtar</h2>
                    <p>First of all
                        <strong>Kalki</strong> is not a person but the <strong>world consciousness</strong> , and
                        that
                        consciousness is in every particle ! <br> <br>

                        The arrival of Kalki means the <strong>awakening</strong> of consciousness ! <br> <br>

                        And that consciousness is inside every human being , everyone is Kalki , you just need to know ,
                        drop your " <strong>I</strong> " and become <strong>Kalki</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        And those who are saying that Kalki will come , he will fight a war, why will he do it , is
                        there a <strong>shortage</strong> of wars in this world , is there ? <br> <br>

                        And with whom will he fight, with those humans who are on the <strong>verge of
                            extinction</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        These people are just <strong>fun seekers</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        Those who are saying that most of the world's <strong>population</strong> will be destroyed and
                        only these people
                        will survive , if this continues, no one will be survived , the entire <strong>Human
                            Civilization </strong> will
                        collapse !

                        This is an <strong>alert</strong> for the entire human civilization ! <br> <br>

                        Some people are saying that Kalki will come and will roam around sitting on a
                        <strong>horse</strong> and holding
                        a <strong>sword</strong> in his hand. Is there any plan to take out a <strong>tableau</strong>?
                        <br> <br>

                        Get out of the <strong>climax</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        All these <strong>prophecies</strong> have been written according to the earlier times ! <br>
                        <br>

                        Today's time is different , the Yuga is different! <br> <br>

                        If there is a sword in today's time, then it is " <strong>knowledge - thought</strong> " ! <br>
                        <br>

                        Using knowledge , humans made <strong>nuclear weapons</strong>, on which the end of human
                        civilization is
                        written! <br> <br>

                        Horses were used in earlier times , horse was a medium to <strong>convey</strong> one thought to
                        another thought
                        !

                        <strong>Wars</strong> always happen between <strong>thoughts</strong>, not between people ! <br>
                        <br>

                        There are no people in this world, there are only thoughts ! <br> <br>

                        Some people have crossed the limit , they are saying that the demon <strong>Kali</strong> will
                        come ! <br> <br>

                        Humans are both Kalki and Kali, if you want to see Kali then look at the corrupt people of
                        today, they are Kali !
                        <br> <br>

                        One corrupt person gives birth to thousands of criminals and rapists! <br> <br>

                        There should be ! <br> <br>

                        Human civilization is based on a balance ! <br> <br>

                        Everything <strong>depends</strong> on you ! <br>

                        Being Kalki does not mean fighting a war, but <strong>stopping</strong> the war ! <br>

                        If these wars do not stop then the end of human civilization is certain ! <br> <br>

                        Some people are saying that along with Kalki ,<strong> immortals</strong> will also come ! <br>
                        <br>

                        they should be ! <br> <br>

                        Chiranjeevi means <strong>immortality</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        Immortality is never <strong>physical</strong>, it used to be there to some extent earlier !
                        <br> <br>

                        Many people in this world are immortal in this world, like <strong>Ram</strong>,
                        <strong>Krishna</strong>, <strong>Hanuman</strong>, <strong>Pandavas</strong>, <strong>Lata
                            Mangeshkar</strong> !
                        <br> <br>

                        The Chiranjeevis that have been talked about are seven <strong>thoughts</strong> (<strong>
                            spirits</strong>
                        ) ! <br> <br>

                        These immortals are symbols of <strong>great thoughts</strong>, and those that you are searching
                        for in the film world will never come !
                        <br> <br>

                        <strong>Ashwatthama</strong> is mentioned more because he was cursed by <strong>Krishna</strong>
                        , which is a
                        <strong>chakra</strong> ! <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        If you divide Ashwatthama in two parts then it is - <strong>Ashwa + Thaama</strong> !
                        <br> <br>

                        Ashva means horses, and horses belong to whom - the mind of " <strong>I</strong> " , Thaama
                        means to hold these
                        horses , to <strong>maintain balance</strong> on them ! <br> <br>

                        So those who could maintain balance over their minds are <strong></strong>cursed free
                        Ashwatthama</strong> and those who
                        could not are <strong></strong>cursed Ashwatthama </strong>! <br> <br>

                        Krishna had cursed Ashwatthama based on his deeds ! <br> <br>

                        That curse is still there, those who cannot maintain balance in their mind "<strong>I</strong>"
                        they always keep wandering, they keep coming and going !
                        <br> <br>

                        They can never be free <strong>until</strong> they balance themselves ! <br> <br>

                        Like the <strong>corrupt</strong>, these are the cursed Ashwatthama, such people never get
                        liberated , as long as
                        they are alive they are <strong>living dead</strong>, they keep wandering after death till their
                        cover called "<strong>I</strong>"
                        ( <strong>unrighteous deeds</strong> ) does not end ,

                        such people do not get another body easily, even if

                        have come when Lord Ram's temple was <strong>demolished</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        If Hanuman Ji had to come, he would have come when Ram’s devotees were <strong>shot</strong> at
                        !
                        <br> <br>

                        Hanuman Ji's era was the Treta Yuga, he did not fight in the <strong>Dwapar Yuga</strong> either
                        ! <br> <br>

                        Here we are not talking about Hanuman Ji's <strong>physical</strong> body, we are talking about
                        spirit , when you
                        remember Hanuman Ji , what feeling comes - <br> <br>

                        It is also possible that these spirits or thoughts are present in people in this

                        <br>

                        You people believe Lord Ram to be God, but on the other hand you call Vibhishan a traitor ! <br>
                        <br>

                        It is right, neither here nor there! <br> <br>

                        Vibhishan is not a person, it is a spirit ! <br> <br>

                        The spirit that makes one abandon unrighteousness and embrace righteousness !
                        <br> <br>

                        When a human leaves Adharma and <strong>adopts Dharma</strong> , then he is called Vibhishana !

                        It is possible that some political party may feel bad about this, but this party has denied the

                        becomes Ram, then this world will become the <strong>home of Gods</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        I knew only a few of these people ( <strong>immortals</strong>) , that too very few, because I

                        Yes , they have also come - I have met all of them - I just did not know ! <br> <br>

                        Still no one knows - except me and Karana ! <br> <br>

                        It took me almost <strong>2.5 years</strong> to meet all of them ! <br> <br>

                        It is not easy to escape from the trap of Kali Yuga ! <br> <br>

                        They are all my friends ! <br><br>

                        First I met <strong>Sudama</strong>, since the time we met, we have talked baseless just
                        nonsense !😅 <br><br>

                        Then I met <strong>Bhima</strong>, he was lying down as usual ! <br> <br>

                        Only earlier he used to get angry, now he gets upset ! 😂 <br> <br>

                        As of today he is a <strong>software engineer</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        Then I met <strong>Nakul</strong> ! <br><br>

                        Today , according to the time, he is a <strong>developer</strong> ! <br><br>

                        Then through Nakul I met Karna and Sahadev ! <br> <br>

                        After <strong>29th Sep</strong>, I met <strong>Yudhishthir</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        At that time, I was writing <strong>GOG</strong>, so he told me what to do next ! <br> <br>

                        He is a <strong>consultant</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        I have also met <strong>Haldhar</strong> during college days ! <br> <br>

                        Even today , we are friends - I just didn't know ! <br> <br>

                        He is a <strong>data engineer</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        As per today's time, this team needs a <strong>weapon</strong> called <strong>ideas ( thoughts
                            )</strong> , <strong>a horse</strong> called the
                        <strong>internet</strong> , and a bow called a <strong>website or software</strong> <br> <br>

                        <strong>Yudhishthira</strong> gave me the idea of ​​a website. Then I went and met Karna. I
                        found out that he had
                        already strung his <strong>Vijay Dhanush</strong> ( Bow ).I just had to make for him a
                        <strong>Brahmastra</strong>. <br> <br>

                        In Treta Yuga there was only one <strong>Ravana</strong>, in this Yuga there is no dearth of

                        <strong>Mahabharata</strong> happened in <strong>Dwapar Yuga</strong>, the reason for which was

                        Everyone is crazy in <strong>unbalanced</strong> love with their son ! <br> <br>

                        That is why such a big team is needed in this yuga, this team has always come in every era as

                        There are other people in this team too ! <br> <br>

                        Someone may say that why do I need such a big team, whenever I have come, I have come for the
                        <strong>welfare of human civilization</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        Whenever human civilization has <strong>strayed</strong> from its <strong>center</strong>, I
