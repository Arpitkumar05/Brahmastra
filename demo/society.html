                        Whose society is it - of <strong>humans</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        I don't know what the definition of a human is ! <br> <br>

                        If humans want to learn about humanity , then learn from <strong>trees</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        They are calm and when a tree falls in the forest! <br> <br>

                        They help each other ! <br> <br>

                        I have heard that this society wants to become <strong>Vishwaguru</strong> ! üòÇ <br> <br>

                        Before becoming Vishwaguru , you have to become a <strong>Guru</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        And before becoming a Guru, you have to become a <strong>disciple</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        Let's look at this great society ! <br> <br>

                        When a person says ‚Äú <strong>Donkey</strong> ‚Äù ! <br> <br>

                        Definition of a donkey - A donkey is one who does not ask questions ! <br> <br>

                        The donkey is complete in itself ! <br> <br>

                        Donkey never thinks that he should be like a human being! <br> <br>

                        That is why they are donkeys ! <br> <br>

                        Let's have a look at some different species of donkeys! <br> <br>

                        They know everything - <br>

                        <strong> Who had a breakup, who had a patch up <br>

                        a shop! <br> <br>

                        It is good for such species, everyone has their own point of view ! üòÜ <br> <br>

                        This species is mostly found at street food joints, and shit there ! <br> <br>

                        When this species goes for a walk in the mountains, they shit there and come back ! <br> <br>

                        This species is found everywhere - they shits in empty plots ! <br> <br>

                        When this species is in a car, it shits through the windows of the cars ! <br> <br>

                        Or if someone gets a good job, will they ask him what he did ? <br> <br>

                        He will do the same ! <br> <br>

                        Then comes the donkey's behavior , this species is found on social media ! <br> <br>

                        This species falls prey to any trend, it follows the donkey's behavior without asking and

                        else but themselves and some of their hypocritical religious gurus ! <br>

                        Those who say that there should be a caste system, also call themselves Sanatani ! <br> <br>

                        Hey , a Sanatani is one who does not discriminate even between a human being and an insect !

                        Just by calling one Sanatani, one does not become a Sanatani, for that one has to be a Sanatani,
                        and a Sanatani can never talk about discrimination, if he does then he is a hypocrite !

                        Caste or Varna system was the demand of the time, so people divided the work on the basis of
                        qualities, with time people themselves got divided on the basis of work ! <br> <br>

                        Nowadays there are a lot of Shudra-Shudra in this country ! <br> <br>

                        According to people the work of a Shudra is to clean the dirt ! <br> <br>

                        So in this case all the Gods , they cleaned the dirt only ! <br> <br>

                        Then they too are Shudras ! <br> <br>

                        Yes, I am also a Shudra! <br> <br>

                        You people have even divided Lord Rama into castes. What can be more unfortunate than this for
                        those who spent their entire lives to eradicating discrimination and protecting human
                        civilization ! <br> <br>

                        Look at Varnas as four arms - and the arms are not unequal !

                        There is not a single Shudra in this country. If there was, then the capital of this country
                        would not have been a garbage dump and neither would Yamuna be a dirty drain ! <br> <br>

                        Everyone is in a race to show themselves as great ! <br> <br>

                        This country needs Shudras and not great people ! <br> <br>

                        There is no need for this old system in today's time ! <br> <br>

                        Change is the law of nature ! <br> <br>

                        And humans are nature itself ! <br> <br>

                        Change or else one day you will be lost ! <br> <br>

                        Because those who do not change , End - this is the law of nature ! <br> <br>

                        Hindus have made their Gods different ! <br> <br>

                        They see <strong>Ram</strong> as a very gentle prince ! <br> <br>

                        He suffered throughout his life but still he kept doing his work with a smile ! <br>

                        He went to the jungle, didn't take anything ! <br> <br>

                        Krishna also suffered throughout his life, but still he kept smiling ! <br> <br>

                        He was born behind the bars of the prison ! <br> <br>

                        Since childhood, he did not get the love of his parents which is most important for a child !

                        Krishna did not just teach singing and dancing, he taught peace and religion, if there should be
                        religion, then how should it be ! <br> <br>

                        If Krishna wants to say something to you, he will say something like this ! <br> <br>

                        If Hindus had learnt something from Ram, there wouldn't have been so many fights between
                        brothers ! <br> <br>

                        If Hindus had learnt something from Krishna, there wouldn't have been so much injustice and
                        atrocities ! <br> <br>

                        The great history of human civilization was heard just like a story and let it go out of the
                        other ear ! <br> <br>

                        If people make a time machine and go back and look, they will not be able to recognize whether
                        this is Krishna or Ram ! <br> <br>

                        A movie was released in which Raavan is roaming around sitting on a bat, now the coming
                        generation will imagine the same ! <br> <br>

                        Hindus say that Muslims are fanatics - why don't they look at themselves, they have also failed
                        ! <br> <br>

                        Osho said that if you choose your friends and enemies carefully, you will become like them !
 <br> <br>

                        And that is what happened , Hindus became fanatics, Hindus became non-vegetarians !

                        This life is the cultivation of karmas, <strong>You reap what you sow , Karma based

                        " Those who kill living beings, their compassion dies, those who do not have compassion do not
                        have wisdom, and those who do not have wisdom cannot attain God ( <strong>salvation</strong> ) ,
                        this is the

                        God is both -  with form and without form , Be it an animal, a human, a tree or the universe !
 <br> <br>

                        You have to find God and on the other hand you have to eat non-vegetarian food ! <br> <br>

                        That's right, you are beating both the drums ! <br> <br>

                        You will have to bear the consequences of this ! <br> <br>

                        There is no God or deity in this world who keeps account of your deeds , that God or deity is

                        If God could be found in books, then <strong>Osho</strong> would have found him long back. He
                        read a lot and

                        Osho gave the title ' <strong>Samadhi from sex</strong> ' because such words attract living

                        So he must have thought that he should free some of them somehow ! <br> <br>

                        Because when a person becomes zero, then it becomes his compulsion to make others zero ! <br>
