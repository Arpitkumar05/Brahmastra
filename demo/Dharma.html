                    <p><strong>Dharma</strong> means - <strong>Rules or laws</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        Like the earth <strong>revolving</strong> around the <strong>sun</strong> ! <br>

                        Which causes <strong>day</strong> and <strong>night</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        The moon revolves around the <strong>earth</strong> ! <br>

                        The working of a <strong>solar system, galaxy</strong> or <strong>universe</strong>! <br>

                        Like the Dharma of a <strong>bird</strong>, chirping in the morning, picking grains, and
                        returning to its nest at
                        night (for example)! <br> <br>

                        Like the <strong>constitutions</strong> of today's countries! <br>

                        <strong>Discipline</strong> or <strong>policies</strong> of a company and the daily routine of a
                        student which he never
                        follows 🤣! <br> <br>

                        According to my father, <strong>family Dharma</strong> (taking care of family no matter what),
                        and I follow
                        <strong>Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam</strong>! <br> <br>

                        Like when human civilization was developing, it must have encountered many different
                        <strong>species</strong>,
                        which we call animals or birds today! <br>

                        So we must have made some rules - to protect ourselves from them, that is
                        <strong>Dharma</strong>!

                    <p>
                        Then we made our own civilizations or <strong>religions</strong> according to our own, like
                        today's humans have
                        their own religions and more are being made! <br>

                        In fact, all the religions in today's world are the history of their <strong>ancestors</strong>
                        and the <strong>thoughts</strong>
                        of their ancestors! <br>

                        Religions had to be created because most humans are unable to <strong>balance</strong> their
                        lives! <br> <br>

                        The number of people who are unable to balance is <strong>high</strong>! <br>

                        Then people made their own religions, like Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Jain, Buddhism….. ..
                        .. .! <br> <br>

                        When people did not follow even these religions, then came <strong>democracy</strong> and
                        <strong>constitution</strong>! <br>

                        Earlier there was <strong>monarchy</strong>! <br> <br>

                        The funny thing is that people do not even <strong>follow</strong> that! <br> <br>

                        Now which religion will you <strong>make</strong> ?<br> <br>

                        Everyone has the same <strong>religion</strong> and <strong>God</strong> – if you got divided
                        then God also got <strong>divided</strong>! <br>

                        There is a religion which is called the <strong>religion of God</strong>, this religion was not
                        made by humans
                        like Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian. Rather <strong>human civilization</strong> started with
                        this religion!

                    <h2>Sanatan Dharma</h2>
                    <p><strong>Sanatan</strong> means <strong>eternal, infinite, beginningless, eternal, God, void,
                            Brihm</strong>! <br>

                        Whatever is <strong>visible</strong> is all Sanatan! <br> <br>

                        Sanatan Dharma and Sanatan are the <strong>same</strong> - Sanatan is in the
                        <strong>formless</strong> and Sanatan Dharma is in
                        the <strong>form</strong> - there is <strong>void</strong> in the formless and one in the form!
                        <br> <br>

                        According to Sanatan Dharma, Sanatan keeps incarnating in different forms from the
                        <strong>particle</strong> to
                        the <strong>universe</strong>. <br> <br>

                        This universe follows Sanatan Dharma, because this universe was created according to the first
                        rule of <strong>Sanatan</strong> Dharma! <br> <br>

                        Sanatan Dharma follows <strong>three</strong> dharmas - <br> <br>
                        <strong>Brahma ( Creation ) <br> <br>

                            Vishnu ( Balance ) <br> <br>

                    <p>According to Hindus, the universe is made up of <strong>five elements</strong>! <br> <br>

                        <strong>Prithvi</strong> , <strong>water</strong>, <strong>fire</strong>, <strong>air</strong>,
                        <strong>space</strong>! <br> <br>

                        These five elements are Sanatan Dharma in <strong>themselves</strong>! <br> <br>

                        Like the <strong>birth</strong> of a universe, a planet, a galaxy, a human, an animal, a tree,
                        <strong>living</strong> a life and
                        <strong>end</strong>! <br> <br>

                        This universe is <strong>alive</strong>! <br>

                        The first and third rules of Sanatan Dharma (<strong>birth</strong> and <strong>death</strong>)
                        are not in the control of humans,
                        if they were, then today's human would have run them according to his <strong>own will</strong>!
                        <br> <br>

                        The <strong>second left</strong> , that is <strong>life</strong>! <br> <br>

                        Following the second rule means <strong>maintaining balance</strong> in life!

                        That happens through <strong>Self Observation</strong>! <br> <br>

                        When a human starts following Sanatan Dharma, he <strong>starts</strong> balancing his life!

                        That happens through Self Observation - by <strong>paying attention</strong> to his own actions!
                        <br>

                        Then he gradually becomes a <strong>Sanatani</strong> as per time!

                        When a human becomes a <strong>complete</strong> Sanatani, then he becomes free from
                        <strong>birth</strong> and <strong>death</strong>, birth and
                        death become more <strong>physical events</strong> for him! <br> <br>

                        He becomes <strong>Sanatan</strong>, he becomes <strong>Shiva</strong>, he becomes
                        <strong>Swayambhu (own master) !</strong>! <br> <br>

                        He connects with the <strong>world consciousness</strong> - he unites with that which created a
                        <strong>human being</strong>! <br>
                        <br>

                        He connects with that which has <strong>zero</strong> connection! <br> <br>

                        He becomes <strong>zero</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        He becomes <strong>free </strong>! <br> <br>

                        Then he does not need any religion or constitution <strong>made by</strong> humans! <br>

                        He <strong>balances</strong> his own life - even while living in any religion or constitution!
                        <br><br>

                        Most people do not follow Sanatan Dharma because they think that Sanatan Dharma belongs to only
                        <strong>a few people</strong>. Everything is Sanatan! <br> <br>

                        People who do not follow Sanatan Dharma - means there is no balance in life! <br>

                        Then <strong>wars</strong> happen!

                        This <strong>Planet</strong>gave birth to human civilization! <br>

                        This planet gave <strong>consciousness</strong> or <strong>life</strong> or

                        <strong>Everything</strong> is working! <br>

                        If all this stops working, then human civilization will come to <strong>an end</strong>! <br>
                        <br>

                        (The universe is like a <strong>web</strong>, everything is connected to each other,

                        That is why one has an effect on the other, like the effect of humans on the climate) <br> <br>

                        When a human being says "<strong>I</strong>", then it is a <strong>point of view</strong> or
                        <strong>thought</strong>! <br>

                        No thought <strong>belongs</strong> to a single person, thought is always
                        <strong>social</strong>! <br> <br>

                        A person <strong>collects</strong> information in his entire life and from that he <strong>forms
                            a viewpoint</strong> and he calls
                        it "<strong>I</strong>" (name)! <br>

                        But "I" is just a <strong>group of information</strong> or thoughts collected from
                        <strong>society</strong>, i.e. a <strong>viewpoint</strong>!

                        That <strong>viewpoint</strong> is - of <strong>seeing the world</strong> - the <strong>world of
                            a human</strong>! <br>

                        Every human has a <strong>different</strong> world, a different viewpoint! <br> <br>

                        When a human <strong>dies</strong>, then the viewpoint "I" <strong>ends</strong>!

                        A <strong>world ends</strong>, for that viewpoint! <br> <br>

                        Because that perspective “I” <strong>stops</strong> observing the world! <br>

                        That is why people say that this world is an <strong>illusion</strong>, the world is not an
                        illusion! <br> <br>

                        Illusion is the perspective called <strong>“I”</strong> (the world of a human), through which a
                        human can <strong>observe</strong>
                        this world! <br> <br>

                        The world is true, eternal and so you are, only <strong>“ I ”</strong> is an
                        <strong>illusion</strong> ! <br> <br>

                        And this perspective ends one day or the other, which means the end of a world for that
                        perspective! <br> <br>

                        As for this world, it also has a <strong>lifespan</strong>, it will end some day or the other!
                        <br> <br>

                        infinity will <strong>remain</strong> Eternal – zero ! <br> <br>

                        <strong>Life</strong> is a <strong>story</strong>, which is written in the memory of humans in

                        <strong>deeds</strong> of a single person! <br>

                        A story is written in many notebooks (memories of different humans) from their
                        <strong>own</strong> perspective!
                        <br>

                        A story can have <strong>many</strong> perspectives, and every perspective has a
                        <strong>different</strong> story! <br> <br>

                        Suppose a human writes a page of the story of his life <strong>every day</strong>!

                        Those pages are also seen from different perspectives (humans)! <br> <br>

                        When a person dies, his notebook becomes <strong>empty</strong> again!

                        A story <strong>remains</strong>, for other people! <br>

                        Sometimes someone's story becomes <strong>immortal</strong>!

                        Then that person becomes immortal. <br> <br>

                        Like <strong>Ram, Hanuman, Krishna, Buddha, Osho</strong> or any <strong>such</strong> people!

                        Because those people balanced their own lives and made <strong>others</strong> do the same! <br>
                        <br>

                        Then the story of such people becomes <strong>history</strong>! As mentioned above, a story has
                        many perspectives
                        (<strong>stories</strong>)! <br>

                        Like some people like Lord Ram and some don't! <br>

                        Some people support Hitler and some don't!

                        The <strong>entire universe</strong> is God. That is why people say that even a leaf moves
                        according to his <strong>will</strong>
                        because whatever is visible, everything is GOD. <br> <br>

                        He just made a beginning and whatever happened after that, everything happened on its own
                        according to time! <br> <br>

                        Some people ask what was there before the <strong>Big Bang</strong>, it was the same, it is the
                        same, and it will
                        remain the same! <br> <br>


                        The Big Bang was a <strong>new beginning</strong>, there were universes before that too. It is a
                        <strong>cycle</strong>, creation,
                        balance, end! <br> <br>

                        That is why it is called Sanatan, it is called Infinite, it is called the world consciousness.

                        God cannot be believed, God can only be <strong>known</strong>!</b> <br> <br>

                        <strong>atheists</strong>, such people are

                        Theist and atheist are just two thoughts of "<strong>I</strong>" (mind), which is just a social
                        information and
                        social thoughts are nothing but illusion, these thoughts end with the end of human!

                        Nowadays everyone wants to find God, these long <strong>queues</strong> in the temple show this!

                        But to find God, one has to be free from the <strong>desire</strong> to find God!

                        If someone really wants to know God then there is only one way, know yourself and to know

                        Erasing the "I" does not mean deleting, it means <strong>rising</strong> above it! <br><br>

                        Because the <strong>Gita</strong> is understood only by those who are above! <br> <br>

                        Start <strong>observing</strong> yourself, if you think you are doing something wrong, like

                        <br>

                        Whatever a human <strong>thinks</strong> happens, like today's world is stuck in such a loop -
                        in which everyone
                        is saying that the world will end, many such films have been made - in which the world has
                        ended! <br> <br>

                        So it will happen, it works like this, whatever a human thinks <strong>happens</strong>! <br>
                        <br>

                        This is its rule, there is no "<strong>no</strong>" in its vocabulary - everything is "yes"!
                        <br> <br>

                        Because you are not asking from him but from <strong>yourself</strong>! <br> <br>

                        <b> You are still the same! <br>

                            Whatever you want will happen! <br>

                        only <strong>Krishna</strong> can handle today's circumstances! <br> <br>

                        Krishna does not come from outside, he comes from <strong>inside</strong>, even if he comes out,
                        you will not be

                    <p>
                        Before understanding heaven and hell, let us understand the <strong>condition</strong> of man!
                        <br> <br>

                        <b>A man thinks about tomorrow only when his day has been <strong>bad</strong>, and tomorrow
                            <strong>never</strong> comes.

                            is there, is <strong>today</strong>, right now! <br> <b></b>

                            Or when a man says that my time will also <strong>change</strong>! <br>

                            Or says that everything will be <strong>fine</strong>! </b> <br> <br>

                        One thing is common in all these sentences and that is <strong>hope</strong>! <br> <br>

                        <b><strong>Hope does not mean that whatever happens will be fine! </strong><br>

                            Hope means that whatever happens will be <strong>seen</strong>! 😁 </b> <br> <br>

                        It means to stop worrying about the future and focus on the <strong>present</strong>! <br>

                        Humans imagine those things which he does not have today! <br>

                        <strong>Similarly</strong>, humans imagine heaven only when he is living in
                        <strong>hell</strong>! <br> <br>

                        Or if he feels that his life is useless, then after <strong>death</strong> he will be able to go
                        to heaven and
                        get all the things which he did not get while <strong>alive</strong>! <br>

                        Like when a human kills a creature, or gets it killed (eats it) <br> <br>
